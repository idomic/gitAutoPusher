* Crontab-Friendly Git Update
Simple shell script for automatic pushing a Git repo via crontab. 
Configure by command "crontab -e" content:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
* * * * * $PATH/auto-git-push $PATH/my-repo
#+END_SRC

This specific example will run every minute. 
This will cause the repo at =$PATH/my-repo= to be pushed every minute.

Script content:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
cd "$1"
git add -A .
git commit -q -m 'automated update'
git push -q
#+END_SRC

The =-q= flags will silence =git= unless an error occurs. This prevents =crontab= from sending email unless an actual error has occurred.

The script also tries to set a reasonable =PATH=. My guess is that this script will run on *NIX systems without modification. I'll leave configuring it for Cygwin as an exercise to the reader :-)
